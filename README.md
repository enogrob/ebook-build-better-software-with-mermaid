**About**

*Creating Software with Modern Diagramming Techniques* teaches developers how to use **Mermaid** to create clear, maintainable diagrams for software design. It covers domain modeling, architecture, user flows, databases, and code structure using **UML** and the **C4 model**, all with practical, code-based diagramming. The goal: better communication, faster understanding, and diagrams that stay up to date with your code.
